# Changelog

- Rewrote the native Windows guardian in Rust for faster hook startup and a much smaller VSIX while preserving power-policy recovery and concurrent-turn behavior.

- The trust retry notice is now non-blocking, and its pre-review hash baseline survives retries and reloads so users can operate the Codex terminal before checking again.
- Setup now verifies that Codex persisted new trust hashes for all three Lid Guard hooks before it marks onboarding complete or reloads VS Code.
- Fixed a restart regression where VS Code could lowercase the extension drive letter, changing the exact Codex hook hashes and causing previously trusted hooks to be skipped. Setup now reopens once so the optimized definitions cannot remain silently untrusted.

## 0.1.1

- Fixed Codex hook execution on Windows by using the documented `commandWindows` override and an explicit non-interactive PowerShell invocation.
- Added a setup command and notification for Codex's required hook review and window reload.

## 0.1.0

- Initial Windows VS Code extension.
- Automatic Codex lifecycle-hook integration.
- Concurrent-turn tracking and lid-state detection.
- Exact AC/DC lid-policy restoration and crash recovery.
- Closed-lid sleep with a configurable cancellation grace period.
